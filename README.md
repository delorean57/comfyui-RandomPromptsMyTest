## Features
- This node fixes some annoying issues related to incorrect generation of random values on the original node, which made generations monotonous and multiple choices related.
- The new node does everything the old one did, but:
   The choices are truly random
   There are no weird connections between different choice blocks

## Requirements
- Installed ComfyUI.
